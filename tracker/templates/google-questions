################# QUESTIONS SUBMITTED THROUGH CHAT #################

* Thx so much for the amazing work. Question: "Why have American journalists not pressed politicians (Obama, etc) on their response to the ICIJ reporting?"

* Will you share specific documents with other journalists who are working on stories for which some of the documents may be useful?

* I'm from south korea. Koreans want to know how many korean ppl in list and who are they.

* A businessman friend of mine asked me for help investigating his business co-founders. I wonder if it's possible to check or for you to check if their names appear in the offshore leaks.

ICIJ discusses offshore project for broad-ranging audience

IRE hosted a Google Hangout on Tuesday with members of the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, who discussed their ongoing investigation into offhore banking secrets. The reporting began with a leaked cache of 2.5 million records, and has since involved -- at last count -- 86 journalist in 47 countries.

Viewers from all over the world tuned in to learn more about ICIJ's project. Cities with live viewers included Chicago, London, Madrid, Narpes in Finland, New York and San Diego.

In a discussion moderated by Wendell Cochran, former IRE board member and Senior Editor of the Investigative Reporting Workshop, the ICIJ discussed obtaining and verifying the data, dealing with the scope of the records and deciding which leads to pursue, diferentiating between criminality and tricks of the rich and famous, collaborating across boarders and the response of various governments.

Hi there, Tony. Many of us here in the UK are trying to uncover information about an allegedly shady offshore entity called "Charlotte 18", linked to the banking industry . I was just wondering how we'd go about confirming if you guys have any information on this. Is there a searchable database anywhere?

Charlotte 18 appeared, on paper, to be a director-less offshore company in the British Virgin Islands, with ties to the banking industry and various sporting, media and commercial enterprises.edgarblamm@hotmail.com
